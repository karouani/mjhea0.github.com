    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How are monopolies created? It seems weird that monopolies can still exist, but they are alive and well despite laws and regulations . With tech companies, it becomes surprisingly easy as they develop or acquire exclusive start-ups, technologies and patents. However, this normally means just temporary dominance in a certain industry until competitors catch up. A true monopoly like those of the 19th and 20th centuries arise when one company dominates every aspect of an industry. The company can then game the market forcing customers to buy their services at that the price and conditions they set. The company benefits from coordinating its services and forces out competitors that specialize or have fewer resources. In short, the company becomes the only game in town. Google faces this daunting boundary as it starts to acquire content producing companies and websites. Is it right for a search engine to also provide content when people rely on it to find content from the top providers?</p>

<h2>Google and Content Creation Not New</h2>

<p>While recent acquisitions raise the ire of consumer advocates, Google was on this path for a while. The biggest acquisition would be the purchase of the popular video website YouTube. YouTube is a veritable geyser of content creation by both professional companies and private users. Google for the time being, doesn't really cross lines because YouTube is more of a platform for creative content than a direct source. However, certain practices on its search engine for YouTube point to possible conflicts of interest that signal a monopoly forming. For example, video results for the search engine put YouTube results before those of other media websites like Daily Motion or Veoh. This is a major problem for market competition when looking at how YouTube benefits from its integration with Google's multi-billion dollar infrastructure. Is it fair for its competitors for YouTube to have such an advantage?</p>

<h2>From Content Finder To Content Producer</h2>

<p>The line gets more blurry as Google looks to provide its own native content for YouTube and other websites. Google recently purchased Next New Networks, a web TV production company. The company has a reputation for creating original content for online viewing producing several popular web shows and shorts. With the backing of a major company like Google and the wide reach of the YouTube platform, the company could soon compete with traditional media outlets like ABC and NBC Universal. The problem lies in how this conflicts with Google's role as a search engine. Google could game search results to put its shows over other companies' products instead of relying on actual user response and interest. The worst part is that users could only detect something wrong after a significant period of time.</p>

<h2>Why Acquiring Content Providers Leads To Monopoly Of Search Results</h2>

<p>YouTube is a general platform. Even if Google provides content, the majority comes from other sources, even competitors like Microsoft and Apple. Google's recent acquisition of Zagat and Frommer's shows what happens when the company directly provides content for the search engines. Zagat and Frommer's are sites that provide online travel guides and information. Its competitors are websites like Lonely Planet. As a subsidiary of Google, there are several ways the company can benefit on Google's search engine. First, the site can get free sponsored adds and searches when users make relevant searches. This is the same as automatically getting to the top of the Google pages. This is unfair to competitors who have to climb the rankings the hard way through building up a following through good content and costly marketing. In essence Google could use its unfair advantage to dominate or acquire competitors in the online travel guide business. Google becomes more and more like the famous political cartoon of Standard Oil. It is an octopus with its tentacles in various web related sectors and industries using its collective advantages to push out legitimate competitors.</p>

<p>The issue is serious, and an interesting indicator of growing awareness about it was its use as a plot point in an episode of the popular Law Procedural/ Drama, The Good Wife. In a recent episode, two college students create a revolutionary voice software that a major search engine sabotages by altering the search results. The reason was they refused to sell their idea and the company buys their competitor and promotes them instead. The show raised the problem of providing direct legal evidence of the crime especially when the plaintiffs were bought out with jobs. Hopefully Google hasn't reached that point yet, but the temptation to follow such actions eventually become irresistible.</p>

<h2>Customers May Act As Check</h2>

<p>Google is unique because its revenue <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/29/google-advertising/">comes</a> indirectly from advertising and depends on the users of its search engine and other products who see its ads. Its services are popular because customers rely on the impartiality of its algorithm to provide the most relevant content. If customers see Google tilting the board in their own favor, it could drive users to alternative search engines such as DuckDuckGo  and Bing. To avoid such scenarios Google has to follow the rules it now uses with YouTube allowing many content providers to use its new content services as a platform. This way it can maintain the separation it needs as a search engine. If not, regulators will step in and limit their actions in more detrimental ways.</p>

    <link href="http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/11/16/the-benefits-of-performing-a-cohort-analysis-in-determining-engagement-over-time/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-16T18:57:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/11/16/the-benefits-of-performing-a-cohort-analysis-in-determining-engagement-over-time</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A cohort analysis is a type of study which is mainly conducted by observation over a period of time. It works by analyzing a given group of individuals who have a trait or experience in common, within a given time. It is a great tool used in retaining customers and it is especially useful for business owners who have websites.</p>

<p>Since more visitors to the site generally translate into more business, it is important to retain these clients and monitor the regularity with which they come back.</p>

<p>The term engagement is used to describe the time that is spent accessing the product. It denotes frequency and it is essential to measure this level and analyze it as it relates to certain intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Time to first purchase or engagement (e.g. follow, post, signup)</li>
<li>% activating in first day, week, month, etc. (B2C vs. B2B)</li>
<li>Repeat rate, 2x%2B repeat rate, 3x%2B repeat rate, etc.</li>
<li>How does first purchase (or engagement proxy) impact future revenue/engagement?</li>
<li>Email Opt-out behavior or member churn</li>
</ol>


<h2><strong>Benefits of Conducting an Effective Cohort Analysis</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>Performing a cohort analysis is a highly effective method of study as it helps to separate the clients into cohorts. Thus, individuals who joined the site during a particular period are grouped together e.g. the March cohort, the April cohort and so on. This way, the analysis of their engagement and how it has changed over time, is unaffected by the individuals in other groups, thus keeping the groups completely independent of one another; and facilitating a more accurate study.</p>

<p><strong>Providing a clear distinction between Growth and Engagement</strong></p>

<p>Separating the clients into cohorts is also effective in clearly defining a difference between growth metrics and engagement metrics. These two measurements can sometimes be confused with each other as growth is the successful addition of clients who use one's product or service. Generally, added numbers automatically increase the overall engagement but it may only be the new clients who access the website, and will probably cease to do so after a while.</p>

<p>Performing a cohort analysis therefore helps one to make a distinction between the two and as a result, the rate of growth, which may be high, does not hide any issues that may need to be addressed as far as engagement or participation and interaction with the product, is concerned. These issues are therefore identified and effectively dealt with in order to facilitate higher retention.</p>

<p><strong>Effective Comparison of data between Cohorts</strong></p>

<p>A cohort analysis also helps one to compare the results between two or more groups. For instance, if the April cohort is more engaged in the product than the March cohort, an analysis may be required on any changes that may have occurred between the two months. In addition, a further analysis may be performed on the groups themselves to see whether the product is possibly appealing to a particular set of people and not another.</p>

<h2><strong>Studying a Wide Range of Data</strong></h2>

<p>By performing a cohort analysis, it is possible to effectively study data across the <a href="http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html">five major metrics</a> (AARRR) for start-ups:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Acquisition:</em> the cost of acquiring first-time users</li>
<li><em>Activation:</em> the speed at which clients are becoming active, including events, in addition to various actions on the website</li>
<li><em>Retention:</em> the ability to retain a client who is engaged in the service - they make purchases and are basically a source of recurring revenue</li>
<li><em>Referral:</em> rate at which people are inviting others to the site, as well as the rate at which the invitees yield to the invitations and actually visit the site</li>
<li><em>Revenue:</em> first point of purchase as far as the client is concerned.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these metrics is important and it is therefore essential that an eye be kept on them to recognize when changes need to be made. A cohort analysis enables one to do just that, without using multiple tools.</p>

<h2>Facilitating speedy Decision Making</h2>

<p>A cohort analysis also helps in identifying times when engagement in the site drops. Since it is a study that takes time into consideration, decisions can be made fast in an effort to rectify the problem areas that may have resulted in the drop. By factoring-in time, there is a clear temporal sequence when analyzing the relationship between first contact with the website, and consequent results.</p>

<hr />

<p>The video below illustrates how a cohort analysis is performed. In my opinion Excel is the best tool to use for cohort analysis as it's much easier than say Mixpanel or Kissmetrics - plus you get your hands dirty and (hopefully) gain an understanding of your data. Although, I really do like <a href="http://blog.rjmetrics.com/see-what-drives-repeat-business-in-your-rjmetrics-online-dashboard/">RJMetrics</a> for cohort analysis as well.</p>

<p>In the video, dummy data has been used on the premise that the business has been operating for an entire year.</p>

<p>That said the data has been generated from real data, which I obtained using <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>. With Zapier, you can easily source data from hundreds of locations like <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/2012/09/18/making-salesforce-work-with-your-favorite-apps/">Salesforce</a>, ZenDesk, Zoho, MySQL, and <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/2012/07/01/shopify-integrations-boost-retention-increase-upsales-and-provide-killer-customer-support/">Shopify</a>.</p>

<p>The video begins with showing you how to divide the users of a service into cohorts, based on the time that they first subscribed for the services. The retention rate has also been included. These values are obtained by dividing the number of users, who are still subscribing after a particular month, by the total number of users who started in each category. The average retention rate is therefore obtained by calculating the average across the cohort.</p>

    <link href="http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/10/19/sentiment-analysis-feelings-not-facts/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-19T14:32:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/10/19/sentiment-analysis-feelings-not-facts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sentiment analysis is a process, which gathers the latest input from a human source or several human sources and uses it to determine the general opinion of a person, place or thing. For example, the old-fashioned comment boxes and comment cards is a form of sentiment analysis. Often called opinion gathering, sentiment analysis can be generated from various technological sources, like Twitter or Facebook. Like the old fashioned comment box, sentiment analysis can help owners or managers find the strengths and weaknesses of a business.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis, using modern social media platforms, benefits your business by giving a true grasp of what the customers think about the business. Customers will say exactly what they think as social media has a cloak of anonymity associated with it. They often will say names and help you pinpoint the best and worst of your employees. Sentiment analysis is important to your business as it aids in evaluation and discovery of the need for new products, services, and improvements.  For example, if a reoccurring tweet on twitter addresses the awful paint on the wall, the business can address the ambiance issue. In addition, the international nature of social media ensures that plenty of people will read the sentiment and adjust their behavior accordingly.</p>

<p>A single opinion posted on the web can damage a business's image quickly. And finding opinions on the web takes only a rudimentary knowledge of search engine. Think of the social media as technical, international version of word-of-mouth. A single opinion can spread like gasoline and a match. Making sentiment analysis of social platforms part of the business's regular routine will help the person in charge limit the damage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a good comment on social media can bring in more customers.  Performing sentiment analysis on twitter and other social media platforms let the business owner market based on the positive sentiment. After all, if one person likes something, such a certain product or customer service, then others will like it, too.</p>

<p>That's why sentiment analysis is important to businesses. It allows business owners or managers to keep their finger on the pulse of their business. The most successful businesses know that customers are the life blood of the business and their opinion matters. Gone are the days of hardwood boxes and paper forms, but sentiment analysis is still just as important to the success of a business. Business owners and managers use it to improve every aspect of their business. How would you use sentiment analysis to improve your business?</p>

    <link href="http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/10/06/differentiating-between-bounce-rates/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-06T14:09:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/10/06/differentiating-between-bounce-rates</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Understanding your site's bounce rate is essential to your online presence success.</p>

<p>A low bounce rate signifies ineffectiveness and lost revenue. A high bounce rate signifies your visitors are meeting your objectives and taking action.</p>

<p>Bounce rate is defined as percentage of visitors who come onto your site and leave your page, or site, after not clicking anywhere else on your site. It is a metric tool that measures the quality of your web pages.</p>

<p>You must understand that bounce rate and exit rate are not the same. Bounce rate is the percentage of people who visit any page of your site without going further. They click off within seconds, or even a split second. Exit rate, on the other hand, is when people leave your site after staying for more than a few seconds. Every visitor needs to exit your website, not every one needs to bounce off.</p>

<p>Before you can differentiate between different types of bounce rates, you must analyze different traffic sources. You need to determine where your traffic comes from and what their bounce rates are. If your incoming traffic sources have poor bounce rates, it will reflect poorly on your rate. The largest amount of converting traffic sources include search engine traffics, email marketing campaigns and affiliate campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>When analyzing your incoming traffic, forget about unqualified sources such as social media sites, unknown referrer sites and random directory sites.</strong></p>

<p>Google Analytics is a wonderful tool for analyzing bounce rates. Combining the data obtained from Google Analytics with the spreadsheet capabilities of Excel 2013 will highlight which pages have increased bounce rates.</p>

<p><strong>Increased bounce rates occur for a variety of reasons including outdated and stale web content, ineffective ad-words and your competition changing tactics. Tactics include enhancing a marketing campaign, implementing effective ad-words, updating web content and reducing prices.</strong></p>

<p>The effectiveness of your keywords, and phrases, will affect your bounce rate. Effective keywords, which provide visitors with information they are looking for, will result in lower bounce rates. On the other hand, if your website uses ineffective keywords, your visitor will leave as soon as they realize your site is not appropriate. Nothing is more frustrating in the Internet world than typing in a keyword or keyword phrase and being taken to a website that has nothing to do with what is being searched for.</p>

<p><strong>Analyze the keywords on every page of your website with a website analyzer tool like Google Analytics. Make adjustments as needed.</strong></p>

<p>Does your landing page contain action-oriented language that stimulates interest? Is the information specific and user-friendly? Is content organized optimally? Then, your bounce rate will be lower since visitors want to stay on your page. They will also be more inclined to view other pages on your site.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your landing page is generalized and/or leads your visitor on a clicking search, your bounce rate will be high. Your landing page will not meet your visitor's expectations and they will quickly leave.</p>

<p><strong>Bounce rates directly impacts your ROI and revenues. They can point out which information/pages need revisions, increase your conversion rate, highlight where you are wasting your money and help you focus in on your objectives. Are you using them to your advantage?</strong></p>

    <link href="http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/09/01/predictive-analytics-top-5-trends-going-forward/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-01T12:50:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://mjhea0.github.com/blog/2012/09/01/predictive-analytics-top-5-trends-going-forward</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one time, when a business or IT person spoke of "business analytics," they were talking primarily about reporting. Today, the reporting function would more likely be termed "business intelligence"  Business analytics has evolved and expanded into an area that just five years ago was considered the exclusive domain of the technically esoteric; predictive analytics, or, the ability to take data and turn it into actionable information.  Like airlines with their sophisticated yield management algorithms, businesses are trying to determine who will do what, when and for what price?</p>

<p>There are a number of trends beginning to surface on the predictive analytics front, and all promise to improve  the way  business is conducted.  Some of the top trends include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Big Data</strong>.  Until recently, big data consisted of disconnected bits of information from social networking, tweets, emails, RFIDs etc. wandering aimlessly through the ether.  But now, the technology (Hadoop, for example) exists to gather and analyze this massive information bank. More and more, big data will become a cornerstone of predictive analytics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion of the user base</strong>.  As predictive analysis tools become more user friendly, they will become a more accessible resource for business users.  This will create the critical mass necessary to make predictive analytics a common practice, and will spur the continued development of new and better tools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Cloud</strong>.  This goes hand in hand with item 2.  Just as better software tools will expand user access to predictive analytics, the cloud will expand company access by eliminating the need for expensive infrastructure investment and maintenance. However, some are skeptical that the cloud will play a major role in the near term. Gartner, for example, predicts a penetration of just 3% of the market in 2013.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mobile</strong>.  Everything is going mobile these days, including applications devoted to predictive analytics.  Tools that aren't mobile-enabled will fall behind, regardless of their effectiveness.  As such, the push by software vendors to develop solutions that are enabled for mobile devices will continue at a rapid pace.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support for Unstructured Data Analysis</strong>. Software vendors today are providing solutions that can marry structured data with unstructured data.  From a predictive analytics standpoint, this is a huge value add.  By being able to include comments and notes, for example, a predictive model can contain much more complete and accurate data, and increase its accuracy.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These are five of the top trends in predictive analytics today, but in a field that is rapidly evolving and expanding, there is no guarantee that tomorrow won't bring new technologies, new trends, and new opportunities.  One thing is abundantly clear, however; the days of decision-making by crystal ball or simply looking backward are gone forever.</p>
